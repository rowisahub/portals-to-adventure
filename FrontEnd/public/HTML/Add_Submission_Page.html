      <p>SECRET DOORS VOLUME 1</p>
      <p>OFFICIAL CONTEST RULES</p>
      <p>03/18/2025</p>
      <p>I. GENERAL DESCRIPTION</p>
      <p>Portals to Adventure LLC is the sponsor of the Secret Doors Adventure Volume 1 Contest ("Contest") and the producer
        ("Producer") of "Portals to Adventure" ("PTA"), a web based and/or streamed and/or television series featuring
        role-playing game adventures and elements and seeking submissions by members of the public of their original written
        adventures depicting exciting role-playing situations or other elements. At Producer's sole discretion, submitted
        Secret Door submissions may also be posted by Producer on, but in no way limited to, the portals-to-advnture.com
        website, the official PTA (@PTAOfficial) fan pages on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok and/or
        Youtube.com/PTAofficial, and may be further used as stated herein and/or in the submission materials. Only Secret
        Door submissions conforming to Producer's Code of Ethics, based on Producer's judgment, as they determine in their
        sole discretion, will be eligible for consideration in the Contest.</p>
      <p>The Contest is currently intended to consist of:</p>
      <p>(i) a single three (3) month-long web administered contest that awards the first- through tenth-place prizes to the
        top ten vote getters.</p>
      <p>See sections IV, V and VI for information on criteria, voting, and prizes.</p>
      <p>All monetary prizes shall be paid in U.S. Dollars unless otherwise determined by Producer in its sole discretion.
        The number of submissions is unlimited, but subject to change in Producer's sole discretion. If the contest is
        unable to be completed due to any event of force majeure or other forces beyond Producer's control, Producer
        reserves the right not to award any or all of the prizes set forth above. Please see section VII of these rules
        regarding additional rules for awarding of prizes.</p>
      <p>II. PROCEDURES FOR SUBMISSION</p>
      <p>1. Persons wishing to enter may upload as many different Secret Door submissions as they wish on the PTA website at
        www.portals-to-advnture.com by following the instructions on the website. Submitting Secret Door submissions on the
        aforementioned digital platform and agreeing to the terms of service thereof transfers exclusive ownership in the
        submitted materials to Producer as of the date/time of acceptance of such terms of service and supersedes any prior
        agreements relating to ownership or otherwise entered in to by the submitter, owner, and/or persons appearing in any
        accompanying submission with any other third party or entity.</p>
      <p>2. Secret Door submissions will be reviewed on an ongoing basis. Regardless of the means of submission of the
        Secret Door submission, submitter (and/or Entrant) hereby agrees to execute all additional paperwork and/or
        agreements as required by Producer to further memorialize and/or record the transfer of ownership and/or any other
        rights or permissions granted to Producer.</p>
      <p>3. All winning submissions that get published in Secret Doors, Volume 1 book become the sole property of Producer and may be used in any manner, commercial or otherwise,
        including without limitation in the Program or any other Program, in any and all media and/or technologies now known
        or hereafter devised throughout the universe in perpetuity. Entrants should keep a copy of their submissions. Submissions that do not win or get published in the Secret Doors, Volume 1 book remain the property of the contestant.</p>
      <p>4. Secret Door submissions created for commercial distribution outside the contest are not eligible for any prizes.
      </p>
      <p>5. Each entrant acknowledges and agrees that Producer reserves the right to edit or otherwise alter each submission
        for any reason, including but not limited to, in order to incorporate or append the Program's graphics, for creative
        reasons, for technical reasons, and/or in order to convert the submission portion into a broadcast-quality
        submission for potential on-air broadcast.</p>
      <p>6. Producer's decisions regarding all Contest matters are made in Producer's sole and absolute discretion and are
        final and non-appealable. All submissions are subject to the terms of these rules and all Entrants agree to be bound
        by these rules and Producer's decisions. Producer reserves the right in its sole discretion to amend these rules at
        any time and Producer will post the revised rules on portals-to-adventure.com. Due to the ongoing nature of the
        Contest, the rules are updated several times throughout its duration; please review them on Portals-to-adventure.com
        frequently. The rules in effect at whatever time the submission is judged will apply regardless of submission date.
      </p>
      <p>7. Producer is not responsible for Internet system and hardware failures; delayed, incomplete or unsuccessful
        transmission of the submission or other entry information; technical malfunctions of any kind; human error;
        information loss and downtime; or any costs, losses, liability or damages resulting from any such failures. In the
        event of any such technical difficulty, malfunction or error, Producer reserves the right, in its sole discretion,
        to take such</p>
      <p>actions as it deems appropriate in keeping with the fairness and integrity of the Contest, including without
        limitation a determination to take no action.</p>
      <p>III. ELIGIBILITY</p>

        anyone involved in the production or administration of the Contest and/or the Program, as well as the immediate

      <p>2. The Contest is open amateur writers who has never held a full-time job creating role-playing games. Freelancers
        with previously published work are welcome to participate.</p>
      <p>3. The Contest is open to Entrants from any country and their immediate family</p>
      <p>members residing with them. Void where prohibited or restricted by law.</p>
      <p>4. Producer reserves the right to modify existing eligibility criteria, including, without limitation, geographical
        and age restrictions.</p>
      <p>5. Entrant must be 18 years of age or older as of the date of entry. Or, written parental consent will be required
        for persons under 18 (or who are not of the age of majority in their state of domicile) for their entries to be

      <p>6. Entrant (and, any person appearing in the entry) must not be a candidate for public office and must agree not to
        become such a candidate for a period of eighteen (18) months from the date of the initial airing of the final
        episode in which the Submission appears.</p>
      <p>7. To be eligible for the Contest, a submission must not have been published or distributed broadcast on prior to
        its first appearance in the Contest. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Producer determines that a submission was
        published or distributed without the knowledge or involvement of the Entrant, Producer may, in its sole discretion
        and in keeping with the fairness and integrity of the competition, permit the submission to maintain its eligibility
        for the Contest.</p>
      <p>8. After submission of Entrant's submission, it must be exclusive to Portals to Adventure, Inc. Entrant agrees to
        complete all additional forms required by Producer and further must be able to grant to Producer all rights set
        forth in such forms, including without limitation, the consent forms and/or other releases as required by Producer
        (collectively, the "Releases"). For the sake of added clarity, Producer's requirement related to completion of
        Releases is not intended to, and does not, alter the fact that exclusive ownership of the submission is granted to
        Producer upon the Entrant's agreement to the online terms of service.</p>
      <p>9. If an Entrant's submission was posted on an internet website(s) before or after the date of submission to
        Producer, Producer reserves the right to have Entrant remove the submission from any website for any reason,
        including which, in Producer's determination, if remaining on such a website would bring Producer or the Contest
        into public disrepute, contempt, scandal or ridicule, or which reflects unfavorably upon Producer, the Contest, or
        any sponsor of the Program or the Contest. Producer reserves the right to disqualify entry at any time if Entrant
        fails to remove Entrant's submission from a website as so directed by Producer.</p>
      <p>10. Each Entrant acknowledges and agrees that his/her submission may or may not receive exposure in any or all
        types of media, including without limitation social media sites, news, and entertainment sites (collectively, the
        "Media"), that competing submissions may receive more or less exposure in the Media prior or subsequent to
        submission to PTA, and that Producer, and/or third parties may initiate, assist or cooperate with Media requests or
        exposure in connection with any submission(s). Entrant understands, agrees and assumes the risk that Media exposure
        of his/her submission, if any, may not be the same or commensurate with that of other competing submissions. Entrant
        explicitly acknowledges and agrees that the Releases provided to Producer by Entrant shall cover any claim, expense
        or liability arising from or relating to such Media contact or exposure, or the lack thereof. Entrant agrees that
        he/she will report all requests for interviews or any other direct or indirect Media contact to Portals to Adventure, Inc. for approval, in Producer's sole discretion, prior to participating in any interview or other Media contact.</p>
      <p>11. The order in which submissions are presented for fan voter review, and the will be determined in Producer's
        sole discretion.</p>
      <p>12. Producer reserves the right to at any time change voting eligibility and procedures.</p>
      <p>13. In addition to the rights granted when uploading submissions to Portals-to-adventure.com, or any other
        electronic form of submission, Entrants whose submissions are chosen for possible inclusion in an episode of the
        Contest must sign a Release and Indemnity in the form presented by Producer attesting, among other things, to the
        fact that they are the rightful owners of the submission and that the submission may be submitted and presented, and
        ownership transferred to Producer, without obtaining permission from or making any payment to any third party.
        Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary herein, Producer's requirement related to completion of
        the aforementioned Releases is not intended to, and does not, alter that exclusive ownership of the submission is
        granted to Producer upon the submitter's agreement to the online terms of service. Any submission containing third
        party content may be subject to disqualification. All persons submitting a submission or appearing in or heard in a
        submission must grant, or must have granted, all necessary rights as required by Producer, which may require,
        without limitation, signing the applicable Release(s) (which shall, among other things, grant to Producer the
        ownership rights in the submission(s), and/or and the right to use such person's name, voice and likeness in any
        manner, commercial or otherwise, and in any and all media and/or technologies whether now known or hereafter devised
        throughout the universe and in perpetuity, including, without limitation, for programming, promotional and
        advertising purposes), and may be provided to submitter after agreeing to the applicable online terms of service and
        submission applications and grants of rights but before the submission can be eligible for prize awards. Failure to
        provide requested Releases and/or consents may result in disqualification of Entrant. Notwithstanding the foregoing
        or anything to the contrary herein, and without limitation of the rights granted to Producer, the submission of a
        submission constitutes the Entrant's permission to use the submission and the name, voice and likeness of the
        Entrant, as well as the Entrant's representation that he/she has obtained all necessary permissions and approvals to
        use the submission and the name, voice and likeness of all persons appearing in the submission, in and in connection
        with the Program and any and all other exploitations thereof or otherwise, including, without limitation, for
        programming, advertising and promotional purposes, in all media and/or technologies, now known or hereinafter
        created.</p>
      <p>14. Each submission must be solely the original work of Entrant(s)/submitter(s) and/or each Entrant represents that
        his/her submission does not infringe on any third party's copyrighted material trademark or other intellectual
        property rights, or privacy or publicity rights.</p>
      <p>15. Each submission must have no AI-generated content.</p>
      <p>16. By submitting an entry, each Entrant agrees to release, discharge, defend and hold harmless Portals to
        Adventure LLC and each of their respective parent, subsidiary and affiliated companies and each of their respective
        licensees, successors, assigns, officers, directors, employees, members, partners, agents and representatives
        (collectively, the "Released Parties"), from and against any claim, expense or liability arising from or related to
        submission, exhibition or exploitation of the entry, participation in this Contest, appearance on the Program, or
        otherwise and/or acceptance or use or misuse of any prize (including any travel or activity related thereto) or any
        breach or threatened breach by Entrant of any provision, representation, warranty or obligation made hereunder.</p>
      <p>17. Each Entrant agrees that his/her participation and submission shall be governed by and construed under and in
        accordance with the laws of the United States and of the State of Nevada applicable to contracts entered into and
        wholly performed therein. Each Entrant consents and agrees to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the federal
        and state courts of the State of Nevada, located in the County of Clarke. Any claims shall be resolved individually,
        without resort to any form of class action, and all such claims shall be limited to actual out-of-pocket costs
        incurred, but in no event to include attorneys' fees.</p>
      <p>IV. SUBMISSION ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA</p>

        determined by Producer in its sole discretion) advance those submissions that meet its policies. Any submission
        which does not advance past Initial Review will be rejected for use as a contestant submission at that time.
        Producer reserves the right to reevaluate any submission at any time, but has no obligation to do so.</p>

        solutions, you can always opt-out of this activity by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) website by

        for the purpose of verifying your identity or authority to make the request. You can also designate an authorized
        agent to make a request on your behalf. Your agent will need to provide a Power of Attorney authorizing the agent to
        act on your behalf, or will need to complete the same verification procedures that would be required for a request
        submitted by you directly, and provide information that allows us to verify your authorization. If you would like to
        appeal a decision related to a request to exercise your rights, please contact us as described above.</p>
      <p>We may deny deletion requests in whole or in part as permitted or required by applicable law. We do not charge a
